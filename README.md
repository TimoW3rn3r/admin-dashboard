# Admin Dashboard

This project was carried out as an assignment for [Project: Admin Dashboard](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

The major goal was to get practice with CSS Grid in a real project environment and recreate this [dashboard layout](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png).

## Live Demo

The site is a responsive web design. You can see the final product in [Github Page](https://timow3rn3r.github.io/admin-dashboard/).

## Credits

SVG icons used in the project were obtained from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) website. And the other images were from random google searches.
